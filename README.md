## credits:

This project was a multidisciplinary endeavor, involving students from at least two different fields of study who collaborated to create the final product.

In this case, the fields were:
- DDM (Digital Design & Motion)
- SD (Software Development)

<br><br>

The art was created by DDM, which included:
Arwen Raven, Rik van der Avoird, and Anne Wieringa.

The code was developed by SD, which included:
Martijn van der Willigen and Baran Günebakan.

Martijn van der Willigen was the project leader of the group, and the research was a team effort.

<br><br>

This version of the website was modified by Martijn van der Willigen to make it presentable for his portfolio and is moderately different from the original.

## The proces and goal:

Our school was acting as the client. Our client wanted a game, website, or app that would display data with visuals based on any pre-selected subject they had chosen.

Our team ended up choosing the environment as the topic. It was still a wide subject, so we narrowed it down to annual trees planted worldwide vs. annual trees cut down worldwide.

<br><br>

Our team concluded early on that a website was the best way to go, as an interactive website could display our facts as efficiently as possible.

This was also supported by the fact that Baran Günebakan preferred web development, while Martijn van der Willigen was open-minded.

<br><br>

Baran Günebakan created the wireframe to give our team an idea of how the website would look, and we proceeded to build it according to this blueprint.

<br><br>

The research was done as a team through websites and fact-checking credible sources, and the findings were collected in a Discord group.

Our team also communicated via Discord to stay in contact about our project.

<br><br><br><br>

This is the "Sources Page," the page where the websites used for research are mentioned.

<br><br><br><br>

This is the "Contact Page"; it's where you'll find the details to contact "Sint Lucas Eindhoven."

## Retrospective:

Despite our team's lack of experience at the time and the fast-approaching deadline, I'm really proud of what we put together.

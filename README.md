## credits:

This project was a multidisciplinary project, meaning students from at least two different studies worked to create the final product.

In this case it was:
- DDM or Digital Design & Motion.
- SD or Software Development

<br><br>

The art was made by DDM which included:
Arwen Raven, Rik van der Avoird, and Anne Wieringa.

The code was made by SD which included: 
Martijn van der Willigen and Baran Günebakan.

Martijn van der Willigen was the project leader of the group and the research was done as a team effort.

<br><br>

This version of the website was Changed by Martijn van der Willigen to make it representable for his Portfolio and is moderately different from the original.

## The proces and goal:

Our school was acting as the client, our client wanted a game/website/app that would display Data with visuals based on any pre selected subject they had chosen.

Our team ended up choosing environment as topic it was still a wide subject, so we narrowed it down to annual trees planted world wide vs annual trees cut down world wide.

<br><br>

Our team had come early to the conclusion that Website was the best way to go about it as a interactive website could display our facts as efficiently as possible.

This was also being supported by the fact that Baran Günebakan preferred Web development while Martijn van der Willigen was open minded.

<br><br>

The research was done as a team via websites and fact checking for credible sources and collected in a Discord group.

Our team also communicated via Discord to keep in contact about our project.

<br><br>

Baran Günebakan made the wireframe to give Our team an idea of how the website would look like and we proceeded to built it by blueprint.

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>





## The website:

Here will be shown what the website looked like.
